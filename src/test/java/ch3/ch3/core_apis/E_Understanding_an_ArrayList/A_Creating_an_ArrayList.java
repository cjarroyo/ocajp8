/*
    - An array has one glaring shortcoming
    - you have to know how many elements will be in the array when you create it and then you are stuck with that choice.
    - Just like a StringBuilder, ArrayList can change size at runtime as needed
    - Like an array, an ArrayList is an ordered sequence that allows duplicates.
    - As when we used Arrays.sort, ArrayList requires an import

    import java.util.*                  // import whole package including ArrayList
    import java.util.ArrayList;         // import just ArrayList

    In this section, weâ€™ll look at creating an ArrayList, common methods, autoboxing, conversion, and sorting.

        ArrayList list3 = new ArrayList(list2);

        //The first says to create an ArrayList containing space for the default number of elements but not to fill any slots yet
        //The second says to create an ArrayList containing a specific number of slots, but again not to assign any
        //The final example tells Java that we want to make a copy of another ArrayList. We copy both the size and contents of that ArrayList
