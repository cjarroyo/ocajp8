public class D_StringBuilder_vs_StringBuffer {
    // When writing new code that concatenates a lot of String objects together, you should use StringBuilder.
    // StringBuilder was added to Java in Java 5. If you come across older code, you will see StringBuffer used for this purpose
    // StringBuffer does the same thing but more slowly because it is thread safe ( Youâ€™ll learn about threads for the OCP exam).
