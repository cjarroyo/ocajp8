    /*
    public static void main(String[] args)
    public static void main(String args[])
    public static void main(String... args) // varargs

    //The third example uses a syntax called varargs (variable arguments)
    //you need to know is that you can use a variable defined using varargs as if it were a normal array
    //For example args.length and args[0] are legal.
