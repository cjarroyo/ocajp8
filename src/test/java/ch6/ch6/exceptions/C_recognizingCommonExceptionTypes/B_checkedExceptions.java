    * Checked exceptions have Exception in their hierarchy but not RuntimeException
    * They must be handled or declared.
    * They can be thrown by the programmer or by the JVM. Example
    *
    * - FileNotFoundException, Thrown programmatically when code tries to reference a file that does not exist
    * - IOException, Thrown programmatically when thereâ€™s a problem reading or writing a file
