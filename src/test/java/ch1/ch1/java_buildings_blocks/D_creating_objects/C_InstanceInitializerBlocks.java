     The code between the braces is called a code block. Sometimes this code is called being inside the braces.
     Anywhere you see braces is a code block.
     Sometimes code blocks are inside a method. These are run when the method is called.
     Other times, code blocks appear outside a method. These are called "instance initializers". In Chapter 5, youâ€™ll learn how to use a static initializer.
