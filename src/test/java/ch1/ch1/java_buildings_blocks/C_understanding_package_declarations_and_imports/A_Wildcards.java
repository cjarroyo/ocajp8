 Java calls more detailed packages "child packages"

public class A_Wildcards {
    /*
    Classes in the same package are often imported together. You can use a shortcut to import all the classes in a package:

    import java.util.*; // imports java.util.Random among other things
    public class ImportExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Random r = new Random();
            System.out.println(r.nextInt(10));
        }
    }

    The * is a wildcard that matches all classes in the package.
    Every class in the java.util package is available to this program when Java compiles it
